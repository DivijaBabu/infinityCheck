            Loving you from a distance has taught me a kind of patience I never
            knew I had, and a depth of affection that surprises me every day.
            Even when miles stretch between us, my heart seems to recognize
            yours instinctively, as if distance is only a physical illusion and
            not something powerful enough to loosen the bond we share. I find
            you in the quiet moments of my day—in the songs that suddenly feel
            warmer, in sunsets that seem incomplete without you beside me, and
            in the silence where your presence is felt more strongly than words.
            I miss you in the simplest ways: the sound of your laughter, the
            comfort of knowing you’re close, the warmth of your presence that no
            call or message can fully replace. Yet, despite the ache, my love
            for you only grows steadier, deeper, more certain. I admire you not
            just for who you are, but for how you love me—gently, honestly, and
            with a sincerity that reaches me even across the distance. There are
            days when longing feels heavy, when I wish I could reach out and
            find you right there, but even then, I hold onto the faith that what
            we share is worth every moment of waiting. You are my safe place,
            even when you are far away, and my heart finds peace in knowing that
            we are choosing each other despite the miles. I dream of the day
            when distance becomes a memory, when longing turns into presence,
            and when I can finally look at you without a screen between us.
            Until then, I carry you with me—in my thoughts, in my prayers, in
            the quiet hope that every passing day brings us closer. Loving you
            feels natural, like breathing, and even from afar, my affection
            remains constant, unwavering, and deeply rooted in the belief that
            our love is strong enough to endure time, distance, and every
            challenge in between.
